<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="homep">
I‚Äôm a dedicated and adaptable professional with a strong background in HR systems and a passion for technology. My journey began in the HR field, where I developed a deep understanding of human resources and payroll processes and challenges. Over the years, I transitioned into the role of an HR system administrator, where I found my true calling in optimizing and enhancing HR systems to better serve users and organizations.
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising (I especially enjoy dancing), travelling and spending time with my family and friends. I‚Äôm always ready to learn and take on new challenges, both professionally and personally.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Renewal of Non-Recurring Fee Payment Process (2023)</h3>
<p class="homep">
As one of the HR representatives, I led the planning, testing, and implementation of a new electronic process for handling non-recurring fee payments. The initiative streamlined the workflow and enhanced user experience. As part of the project, two new system integrations were developed: one linking the fee system to the payroll system, and another connecting it to an electronic archive system. 
<br><br>
The updated process was piloted in 2023 and successfully launched organization-wide in 2024, replacing manual procedures with a more efficient and transparent digital solution. Since the launch, I have acted as both the HR system administrator and the process owner.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Renewal of Working Time Management System (2018)</h3>
<p class="homep">
As the HR representative, I was responsible for the planning, testing and implementation of a new mobile working time management system. The initiative aimed to replace physical clock-in/out devices with a modern solution accessible via a mobile phone application, enabling more flexible and user-friendly time tracking. The project was carried out in close collaboration with the service provider‚Äôs consultant, ensuring smooth system development and integration.
<br><br>
The new system was piloted in 2018 and successfully launched organization-wide in 2019, improving accessibility, data accuracy, and overall efficiency in working time management.
